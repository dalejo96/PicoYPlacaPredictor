# PicoYPlacaPredictor

This is a simple console program related with the **Pico Y Placa Restriction** in Quito, Ecuador. Gives you the chance to know if your car can or cannot go to the streets acording with: 
1. _Plate Number_ with the format (####)
2. _Date_ with the format (yyyy/MM/dd)
3. _Time_ with the format (HH:mm)

The program forces you to enter the correct data types in each field and also  in the right format.

Finally, lets you know if you can or cannot go to the streets with a string as:

- You can go to the streets! :-)
- You cannot go to the streets! :-(

This program was made following the Test-driven development (**TDD**)

Thank you for take a look!
